Syracuse University aspires to be a pre-eminent and inclusive student-focused
research university, preparing engaged citizens, scholars, and leaders for

to attract and engage the best scholars from around the world, yet small enough

global study, experiential learning, interdisciplinary scholarship, creativity,
and entrepreneurial endeavors; Balancing professional studies with an intensive
liberal arts education; Fostering a richly diverse and inclusive community of
learning and opportunity; Promoting a culture of innovation and discovery;

and impact
